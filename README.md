# Levels FYI Project

This app should meet these requirements: 
> Build a website using Next.js (https://nextjs.org/) and deployed to Vercel’s free tier (https://vercel.com/). The website should have two pages, the first should just state “Hello World” and second should have a table with list of all country names in it. On the page with the table, add a input field. Typing into the input field should automatically update the table to only show matching country names. Ex. Typing 'Al' should return "Albania" & "Algeria”. Follow best coding practices and convention. Share the repo along with the link to the live site when complete.

So, it has an index page (`/`) and countries list page (`/countries`).
